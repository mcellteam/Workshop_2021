# BioNetGen

BioNetGen is software for rule-based modeling of biochemical systems. In the workshop you will learn how to construct, simulate, and analyze both nonspatial and compartmental models of biochemical systems. We will focus on the construction of simple models and then show how the same biochechemisty that we can represent in BioNetGen can also be simulated in MCell, where molecules and compartments have explicit spatial representation. We will compare results of the models to learn the role that space plays in cellular biochemistry.

## Requirements

If you are using your own laptop, install [VS Code with BioNetGen extension](https://bng-vscode-extension.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
